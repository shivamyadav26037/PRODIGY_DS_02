**### Task 2: Titanic Dataset Analysis**

 Objective
Explore and analyze the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and relationships in passenger data â€” such as survival rates by gender, class, and age â€” and visualize these patterns using statistical plots.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data Overview:
Used .info() and .describe() to understand column types, null values, and summary statistics.
Identified missing values using df.isnull().sum().

Correlation Heatmap:
Created a heatmap to visualize relationships between numerical variables.
Strongest positive correlation observed between Pclass and Fare.

Age Distribution:
Visualized age distribution using histogram with KDE curve.
Shows a peak around 25-30 years.

Survival by Passenger Class:
Used seaborn countplot to show survival distribution across classes.
Passengers in 1st class had higher survival rates.
